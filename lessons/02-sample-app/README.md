# Review a Redux App that will be Converted to RTK Query

The sample app we're using for this site can be found here:
https://github.com/xjamundx/egghead-rtkq

It's a website for dog grooming that has a few important features:

- Seeing a list of services loaded from an API
- Filtering that list based on your list of dogs
- Adding and removing dogs from your list
- Sending a message via the contact form

The app itself is powered by https://vitest.dev/ and https://mswjs.io/.
