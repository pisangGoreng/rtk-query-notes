# Migrating a fetch() Call from redux to RTK Query with builder.query()

In this lesson we use the `builder.query()` to define an extremely simple endpoint.

It's worth noting that `query()` takes an object with a property confusingly called `query` which can return a URL, which is all we do here. It can also return an object, which we'll see in later lessons.

For more information about queries, see:
